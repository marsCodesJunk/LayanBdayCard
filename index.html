        <p>To my ride or die,</p>
        <p>
          Look how far we've come! I can't be happier to have lived
          most of my life with you. from little geeky sixth graders
          to not so little, still geeky college students.
          I'm so proud of you and how much you've achieved and
          how you always try to be the truest version of yourself.
          I will forever cherish the incredible bond we have &#10084;.
          happy birthday and to many more and to us 
          celebrating all of them together!
